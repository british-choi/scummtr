SCUMMFONT(1)                General Commands Manual               SCUMMFONT(1)

NAME
     scummfont - transform SCUMM fonts to bitmap image files

SYNOPSIS
     scummfont i FONTFILE image.bmp
     scummfont o FONTFILE image.bmp

DESCRIPTION
     The scummfont tool transforms SCUMM CHARv1 and CHARv3 font files between
     their internal format and a bitmap representation.  The mode of operation
     is chosen with one of the following options:

     i       Import the content of an image.bmp bitmap file into the specified
             FONTFILE SCUMM resource.

     o       Extract a font from a FONTFILE SCUMM resource into an image.bmp
             bitmap file.

     FONTFILE can either be a "CHAR_*" block extracted by scummrp(1), or an
     LFL file containing a font resource.

     Generated bitmap files contain every character available in the selected
     font.  Characters are sorted in the ascending order of the font table;
     that is, the 19th displayed character is always accessible in a
     scummtr(1) translation file by using the "\019" decimal sequence.

HISTORY
     The scummfont tool was written between 2003 and 2004 by Thomas Combeleran
     for the ATP team, and was open-sourced in 2020 under an MIT license.

CAVEATS
     Only simple, uncompressed 8-bit per pixel BMPv3 bitmap files (also known
     as Windows 3.x bitmap files) with 256 colors are supported.

     If your input file is rejected after having been modified by an external
     tool, Netpbm can be used to revert it to a compatible format:

           $ bmptoppm input.bmp | ppmtobmp -windows -bpp 8 > output.bmp
